# World Builder saved worlds — the listing a viewer opens old worlds from

**Living document.** Added 2026-09-06.

| | |
|---|---|
| Contract | `world_builder.worlds/2026-09-10` |
| Transport | HTTP `GET /worlds`, same origin and same rules as the geometry routes (`WORLD-BUILDER-GEOMETRY.md` §1) |
| Tower producer | `tower/tower/results/world_builder_library.py` |
| Tower route | `tower/tower/routes/geometry.py` |
| iOS consumer | `ios/Glasses/Workspaces/WorldBuilder/WorldLibrary.swift` (compiled and tested on the Mac, 2026-09-06; the 2026-09-10 id bump has **not** been compiled — Windows lead) |

## 1. Why it exists

The Tower already serves any world by id (`/worlds/{id}/geometry/…`) and the
status subscription already pins a stored world (`result_subscribe` with
`world_id` / `session_id`, `WORLD-BUILDER-IOS.md` §6). What no client could do
was *find* an id. This is the index, and nothing more: it carries no geometry,
no imagery, no per-keyframe data.

## 2. `GET /worlds`

**404** when no world root is configured. **200** otherwise, including when
there are no worlds (`worlds: []`).

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `contract` | string | `world_builder.worlds/2026-09-10`. Compared for equality; a mismatch refuses the payload |
| `world_count` | int | Length of `worlds` |
| `worlds` | array | Newest `updated_at` first |

Per world:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `world_id` | string | The id the geometry routes and the status pin take |
| `display_name` | string \| null | As stored. `null` means unnamed, never `""` |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | number | Tower-receipt epoch seconds |
| `live` | bool | A builder process holds this world's writer lock **right now** (its pid is running). A live world is still changing; open it as such |
| `session_count` | int | Length of `sessions` |
| `sessions` | array | Oldest first |

Per session:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `session_id` | string | The id the geometry routes take |
| `started_at` | number | |
| `ended_at` | number \| null | `null` means still open, **not** zero |
| `end_reason` | string \| null | `stop`, a disconnect reason, or `null` while open |
| `frame_source` | string | `live-capture`, `recorded-capture`, `synthetic` |
| `capture_id` | string \| null | The capture this session followed, when it followed one |
| `keyframes_accepted` | int | As recorded on the session |
| `has_geometry` | bool | **Opening this session would show the wearer something.** The geometry manifest may still answer `current: false`. **Amended 2026-09-10 — this is why the contract id moved.** It used to mean only that `poses.json` and `points.json` exist, and `engine.build` writes both unconditionally: a walk that solved nothing leaves a `points.json` holding `{"points": []}`, 14 bytes. **Eleven sessions on the real 163-world root were reported `has_geometry: true` over exactly that**, while the status channel for the same session projected `needsRetry` — the picker promising a wearer something to look at and the panel behind it saying nothing came of the walk. It is now the same question the status channel asks, of the same figures: `points > 0` or `poses_positioned > 0`, from the session's manifest, or counted from `points.json` when no manifest describes it |
| `abandoned` | bool | `ended_at` is `null` **and** the world is not `live`: the builder ended without finalising the record (killed inside the Tower's shutdown grace, or by hand). Its `keyframes_accepted` is then the start-of-session value, not the journal length, and its geometry is whatever the last interim build wrote. Additive (2026-09-06, Windows validation) |
| `state` | string | One word, the status channel's lifecycle vocabulary: `receiving` (a live builder, session open), `finalizing` (a live builder, session stopped — the final solve and build are running), `complete` (finished; `finalization.state == "complete"` **and** geometry on disk, or an older record that stopped and built), `interrupted` (killed mid-walk, killed mid-finalization, stopped by a request or an error, **or a session whose manifest records real figures and whose derived tree is gone** — something happened to this session, which is what the word claims), `unbuilt` (**there is nothing to open**: a record that stopped and never built, or one whose build ran and found nothing — a dark corridor, a blank wall, a calibration that never arrived. iOS renders it “No geometry”, which is the whole claim. It is deliberately NOT `interrupted`: nothing was interrupted, and saying so tells a wearer the walk failed when it merely found nothing). Additive (2026-09-06, live-history lane); **amended 2026-09-10**, which is why the contract id moved: `complete` gained the `has_geometry` requirement and `interrupted` gained the manifest-without-a-tree case, so a word a phone already implements now arrives in states it did not before. Nothing was added to the shape — an older phone decodes every field; it simply draws a different word. |
| `keyframes_journaled` | int | Lines in the keyframe journal. On a record that never stopped `keyframes_accepted` is still the zero written at start; this is what actually landed (467 on the 09-06 walk against a recorded 0). Show this when the two disagree. Additive (2026-09-06) |
| `finalization` | object \| null | The builder's own record of what happened after the session stopped: `{state: pending\|complete\|interrupted, final_solve: pending\|solved\|skipped\|failed\|unavailable\|null, started_at, updated_at, detail}`. `null` on records written before 2026-09-06 and on sessions that never stopped. Additive (2026-09-06) |

## 3. Rules

1. **Absent is never zero** (`WORLD-BUILDER-GEOMETRY.md` §6 applies): `ended_at: null` is an open session; `display_name: null` is an unnamed world. An open session with `abandoned: true` is not still open: nobody is writing it, and a client should say so rather than "still open". Prefer `state` when it is present; `abandoned` is kept for clients that predate it.
5. **An interrupted session is not hidden and is not presented as finished.** `state: "interrupted"` with `has_geometry: true` is a world a person can open and look at (the render route serves it); the row must say interrupted and must not say complete. A live Tower has no reason to hide the 2026-09-06 walk, and every reason not to call it finished.
6. **Worlds with no sessions are shells**, left by a builder that opened a world and never received a frame (96 of 162 on the Windows box). A picker may fold them away; it must not offer them as the primary rows.
2. **A world that cannot be read is omitted, never invented.** A session that cannot be read is omitted from its world.
3. **No imagery, no paths.** `capture_id` is an opaque id, not a location.
4. Opening a world means: subscribe with `world_id` (+ `session_id`) on the status channel, then pull geometry exactly as for the live world. There is no second geometry path.

## 4. `GET /worlds/{world_id}/render` — the interactive viewer

Added 2026-09-06 on the Mac integration branch, so a saved world can be
*looked at* from inside the app. Same origin and rules as §2.

| | |
|---|---|
| Tower producer | `tower/tower/results/world_builder_render.py`, composing with `tower/tower/world_builder/render.py` — the same code `scripts/world_render.py` writes `world.html` with |
| iOS consumer | `ios/Glasses/Workspaces/WorldBuilder/WorldRenderViewer.swift` (a `WKWebView` that loads nothing else) |

| Query | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `session_id` | string, optional | The session to draw. Absent: the newest session of the world that has geometry (`has_geometry` in §2) |
| `max_points` | int 1…200000, optional | Point budget; default 80,000 for a phone. Fractional-stride sampling over every segment, never a prefix |

**200** `text/html`, `Cache-Control: no-store`. A self-contained page: no
external script, stylesheet, image or fetch, so a web view that refuses
every navigation but the initial one shows it whole. One finger orbits,
two fingers pinch to zoom and drag to pan; on a desktop, drag / wheel /
shift-drag. A `<select>` switches between the drawable spaces: the shared
world frame(s) first, then every unregistered segment in its own frame and
own scale, named as such. The page carries a caption saying what it is —
*sparse structure-from-motion output: triangulated feature points and
camera poses; not a surface, not a mesh, not metric scale* — and a second
line when the derived tree is behind the newest keyframes.

**404** with a `detail` the phone shows verbatim, for exactly these:
no world root configured; no such world; no such session in that world;
the named session has no geometry yet; no session of the world has
geometry yet. The last two are what a world still being built or solved
answers: the client's response is to say so and offer to try again, not to
treat it as an error in the world.

**422** for a `max_points` outside its range.

### Rules

1. What is drawn follows `WORLD-BUILDER-GEOMETRY.md` §5 rule 3 and §7 exactly: a segment is placed in the world frame only when its placement is `registered`, complete, and bound to the current build. Everything else is drawn apart, labelled, never overlaid.
2. The page never claims more than the caption says. A viewer that shows it must not either.
3. Composed on request, cached nowhere: a world under construction changes with every build, and the client bypasses its own cache for the same reason the geometry routes ask it to.
4. `world_id` passes the same containment guard as the geometry routes (`contained_world_id`): an id that resolves outside the world root is "no world", and a non-canonical spelling is answered as the world it names.
5. **One derived manifest per world, not per session.** `derived/manifest.json` records the digest of the *last* build, so in a world with two built sessions the older one's placements no longer bind to it: that session renders with every segment apart, labelled `unbound`, and the BEHIND caption — which is the truthful reading of a tree the current build did not produce, not a defect in the session. `GET /worlds` still answers `has_geometry: true` for it. A per-session manifest is the fix and belongs to the store, not to this route.
6. The response carries `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'` — the promise above, enforced by the browser as well as kept by the producer.
